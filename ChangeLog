	* htmldiff.c: renamed error() to errexit() and added an
	implementation of it, since the Mac OS X doesn't seem to have

	(reformat_diff_output): Instead of opening files, rewind them.
	Reported by Ze'ev "Steed" Shtadler (Israel).

	* wdiff.c (main): Allow "" and "-" for representing standard input,
	but consistently store NULL as file name in these cases.  Disallow
	having standard input twice.

	* wdiff.c: Use error() instead of perror(), everywhere.  Include
	<errno.h> and declare errno if not defined.

	* wdiff.c: Implement -c for ignore_case.  I should have delayed
	this until the integration of wdiff into diff, but I personnaly
	needed it right now! :-)

	to the basename of the program.

1992-12-23  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* wdiff.c (split_file_into_words): Call tmpnam just before opening
	the file.  On the Next, successive calls to tmpnam will return
	different values only if the file is opened in between.
	(main): Allocate temp_name statically, and initialize it to "".
	On certain systems, tmpnam(NULL) causes a segmentation violation.
	Length will be L_tmpman or else, PATH_MAX from pathmax.h.  Check
	temp_name before unlinking, in case of an intervening signal.
	Reported by Thorsten Ohl.

	* Makefile.in (_wdiff.o): Use -I$(srcdir).

	(main): Initialize and decode it.
	(usage_and_exit): Announce it.
	(copy_whitespace): Implement it.

	* wdiff.c: Remove `const' to `char *strstr();' declaration.
	Reported by Roland McGrath.

1992-11-18  Jim Meyering  <meyering@idefix.comco.com>

	* Makefile.in: Add another layer of double quotes so PAGER
	and DIFF may contain spaces.  Before, with PAGER='less -i'
	compilation failed with unterminated string.

1992-10-06  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Makefile.in: Use exec_prefix.  Add `uninstall'.

1992-08-20  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

1992-08-18  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* unproto.l: New, from ~/src.  Note that flex is required.
	* Makefile.in: Add U, apply unproto to wdiff.c and version.c if
	not __STDC__.

1992-08-17  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* wdiff.c: Insure exit code values: 0 if no differences found, 1
	if any difference found, 2 for other reasons or errors.  Execute
	`diff' even in the case absolutely no output will result.

	* wdiff.c: Removed spurious comma after last enum item.

1992-08-16  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

1992-08-15  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* wdiff.c: Added -s option to produce statistics at end of output.

	* wdiff.c: Copy common code from the left side instead of the
	right side if only the common code and deleted words are wanted;
	this makes the output spacing nicer.  Also, correct a bug by which
	added words were shown as common code for this option set.

	* wdiff.c: PAGER_PROGRAM was previously defaulted to "more", it is
	now left undefined.  As currently set, the auto-configurator will
	pick one, however, and force it into the program.

	* wdiff.c: Avoid all emphasis if all of the output would be
	emphasized the same way.

	* wdiff.c: Avoid overstriking whitespace unless the pager is less.

	* wdiff.c: Do termcap initialization and completion strings.  If a
	pager is used, insure they are sent to stdout, never to the pager.

	* wdiff.c: If PAGER is defined, but to the empty string, avoid
	using any pager, instead of using a default PAGER.

1992-08-14  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* wdiff.c: Remove the `signal (SIGCLD, SIG_IGN);' which is a
	System V-ism, and rather wait() explicitely.

	* wdiff.c: Declare tgetstr if <termcap.h> not included.

1992-08-12  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* wdiff.c (setup_signals): Do not intercept SIGQUIT.

	* wdiff.c: Automatically pipe through `more' or `less' if writing
	to terminal, using environment variable $PAGER to override PAGER
	definition.  Force terminal mode, but if the pager is `less', use
	printer mode.  Modify copy_whitespace for overstriking whitespace
	with itself in printer mode: `less' understands this.
	* Makefile.in: Transmit PAGER to program.

	* wdiff.c: Options -wxyz renamed from old -1234.  New options -123
	acting a little like in comm utility, old -d option deleted.

	* wdiff.c: Check for HAVE_TPUTS instead of HAVE_TERMCAP_H in many
	places.

1992-08-11  François Pinard  <pinard@iro.umontreal.ca>

	* Initial packaging.
